# Pong PSP
A simple 2-player Pong game made for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). This was made using the [`QuickGame API`](https://github.com/IridescentRose/QuickGame) and a [`video tutorial by Iridescence`](https://youtu.be/J3xVZsjFDhw).

# Installation
- Make sure your PSP has Custom Firmware installed, such as PRO-CFW. This will allow unsigned code to run. <br/>

Download the ROM from the [`releases page`](https://github.com/SpyderGamer/Pong-PSP/releases) and extract the contents to this directory on the PSP Memory: `PSP/GAME/Pong`. <br/>

Note that you can also play this on an emulator such as PPSSPP.
